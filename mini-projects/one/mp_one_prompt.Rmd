Create program that:

- Requests: 'Enter a noun.'
- Checks to see if the noun is a nominalization.
- If so, prints: 'I think [noun] is a nominalization.'
- If not, prints: 'I don't think noun is a nominalization.'

Write an executive summary (1-2 pages) that addresses:

- Your operational definition of a nominalization
- Strengths and weaknesses of your program
- Challenges associated with identifying nominalizations

_Bonus task:_

- If the word is a nominalization, attempt to isolate and print the root word
