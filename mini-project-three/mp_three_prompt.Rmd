Create a program that:

- Requests a yes or no question.
- Answers the question in a complete sentence.
- The program should decide whether to answer in the affirmative or negative, based on a random number.
- Example:
  - Input: Is programming fun?
  - Output 1: Yes, programming is fun.
  - Output 2: No, programming is not fun.
  - The output will be decided by the program randomly.

Once you have a basic version of the program working. Try to accurately answer more challenging yes/no questions like:

- Is programming in Python fun?
- Do I like to program?
- Can a computer really understand my questions?
